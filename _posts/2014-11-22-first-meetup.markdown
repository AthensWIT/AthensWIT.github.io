There is a new group in Athens! We are calling ourselves Athens Women in Tech. AWIT is part of <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Greater-Athens-Area-Software-Developers/">Developers of Athens</a>, but we are about more than just development. We want to provide a connection point for all Athens women in the tech community, whether they are in development, sales, marketing, education, or other roles, as well as men that are interested in what we are doing. Our first meetup will be on December 9, 2014 at Hendershots at 7pm. For this first meeting, we're keeping it simple with a meet and greet for everyone interested in learning more about the group. Come meet the co-organizers, Karla and Liz. We hope to see everyone from the tech community, not just women. Guys - come out and show your support and meet the people that will be involved!

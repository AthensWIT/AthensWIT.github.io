  <p>Four Athens' biweekly Coffee Catch-Up on November 1 focused on Athens
  Women in Tech, what plans and aspirations we have for the group, gauging
  people's interest in various aspects like tech talks, other types of talks
  (like one on negotiating came up), more class- or workshop-like events like
  RailsBridge, hackathons, working with a group like Girls Rock! to have a code
  camp or something, and what peopleâ€™s leaning is toward some events being for
  any and all women and some being inclusive of our cool and supportive menfolk
